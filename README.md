## Abstract
This study explores advanced mathematical techniques for optimizing medical image analysis,
focusing on enhancing brain tumor detection. By using singular value decomposition, image
noise is reduced and key features are preserved to improve diagnostic accuracy. Key tumor
features, such as intensity gradient, texture pattern, shape irregularity and contrast. Powerful
feature enhancement methods, including contrast normalization and image transformation,
further improve image quality. The analysis of the main components was used to reduce
dimensionality, retaining 93% of the data variance, while the support vector machine classifier
achieved a high accuracy of 93%. Cross validation confirmed that this performance is robust
(accuracy 97.4%, AUC: 0.99). Compared to deep learning models, this framework significantly
reduces computational requirements for environments with scarce data. The research results
have demonstrated the effectiveness of integrating mathematical methods for medical image
enhancement and classification, as well as effective tumor diagnosis.
